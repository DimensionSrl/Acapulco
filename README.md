## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+

- Xcode 6.3

## Communication

- If you **found a bug**, open an issue.
- If you **have a feature request**, open an issue.
- If you **want to contribute**, submit a pull request.

## Sample Project

In order to jump start, you can create the certificates in the [iOS Development Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/overview.action) and use the provided sample project to test the notification system.
Keep in mind that you need to change the *bundle-id* of the application, generate the corresponding *provisioning profiles* and the *certificates* (distribution and push) as explained in the [Local and Remote Notification Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH1-SW1).

## Installation

### Manually

You can integrate Alamofire into your project manually, just drag and drop the `Acapulco.swift` file in your project.

### CocoaPods

Cocoapods support is coming, stay tuned.

## Usage

### Setup remote Push Notification server

In order to maintain the registered device archive and send push notifications you need a remote endpoint. Introducing ThunderBay!

#### ThunderBay

To speed up the process you can use the sample [ThunderBay](https://github.com/DimensionSrl/ThunderBay) push notification server and deploy it to your server.
However we've setup a *demo instance* that will be purged frequently, to let you jump start. You can find it at [acapulco.dimension.it](http://acapulco.dimension.it).


### Register for remote notifications

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
    // Attempt to enable push notifications
    let types : UIUserNotificationType = .Badge | .Sound | .Alert
    let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: types, categories: nil)
    UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)
    return true
}    
```

*Those instructions are intended for iOS 8+.*

### Setup Acapulco

`serverAddress` is your endpoint.
`applicationKey` is the application identifier, in this case provided by *ThunderBay*.

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData) {
        Acapulco.sharedInstance.register(apnsToken:deviceToken, serverAddress:"acapulco.dimension.it", applicationKey: "8ef1bd2601579e98")
    }
}
```

### Setup Acapulco

`serverAddress` is your endpoint.
`applicationKey` is the application identifier, in this case provided by *ThunderBay*.

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData) {
        Acapulco.sharedInstance.register(apnsToken:deviceToken, serverAddress:"acapulco.dimension.it", applicationKey: "8ef1bd2601579e98")
    }
}
```

### Handle foreground notifications

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject]) {
    if(Acapulco.sharedInstance.handleNotification(userInfo)) {
        // You received an Acapulco notification. Acapulco handled it, but you
        // might want to do something with it too.
    } else {
        // Acapulco does not know how to handle this notification, but maybe you will.
    }
}
```

### Handle background notifications

```swift
// TODO: needs to be finalized

```

### Handle application launches from notifications

```swift
// TODO: needs to be finalized

```
